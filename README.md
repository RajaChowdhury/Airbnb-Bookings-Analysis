I have done a complete Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Airbnb Hotel Bookings where I have find the lastest trend and key insights which help to makes strategies and understand the customer behaviours.



## Description

This project is about Airbnb which operates on an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, New York City, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. which became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that has been analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. So in this project I have tried finding the insights and the hidden trends of Airbnb and also made some recomendations to optimize its strategies.
