I have done a complete Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Airbnb Hotel Bookings where I have find the lastest trend and key insights which help to makes strategies and understand the customer behaviours.



## Description

This project is about Airbnb Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

This project is about Rossmann company, which operates over 3000 drug stores in 7 European countries and Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. So, the goal of the project is to predict the daily sales for a chain of drugstores (Rossmann stores) based on various factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, etc.

The data provided for this problem includes a history of daily sales for each store, along with additional information such as store location, type of store, and relevant promotions and events. The challenge is to use this data to build a model that can accurately forecast sales for each store. This can help Rossmann retail stores to optimize their supply chain, better manage their inventory and make informed decisions about promotions and other marketing strategies.
